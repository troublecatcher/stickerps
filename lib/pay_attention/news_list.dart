        'Death Valley National Park now offering a rare opportunity – kayaking',
    content: '''
Because of excessive rainfall in California, a temporary lake is giving folks a rare chance to do some actual kayaking of all things in the driest place in the United States, the National Park Service said in a recent news release.

The aquatic adventure is taking place at Badwater Basin, which lies at the bottom of Death Valley National Park. It is the lowest elevation in North America at 282 feet (86 meters) below sea level.

Badwater Basin is normally a dry salt flat, the NPS said.

“You might think with no drain to the sea, that Death Valley would always have a lake,” said park ranger Abby Wines in the news release. “But this is an extremely rare event. Normally the amount of water flowing in is much less than the evaporation rate.”

Death Valley National Park averages about 2 inches of rain per year, the NPS said in the release. But the valley floor has gotten 4.9 inches in the past six months. The surrounding mountains have seen even more rain.

    title: 'Want to try this beef snack? Join the 43-year waitlist',
    content: '''
In Takasago City, Japan, a brand of frozen Kobe beef croquettes is so popular that the waiting list is longer than most mortgages. Customers must wait 43 years before they can lay claim to the covetable “Extreme Croquettes” — maybe update your will if that timeline’s getting tight, though.

Japan’s long been at the forefront of technological innovation. Bakery chain Kimuraya is advancing that further by using AI to produce “romance bread” targeted at the nation’s love-averse youth. There are five themed flavors: a fateful encounter, a date, jealousy, heartbreak and mutual love.

The Japanese island of Kyushu is where sugar was first introduced to the country by the Portuguese in the 16th century. The island retains a sweet tooth to this day and is home to Japan’s most beloved sweet treats. Try to squeeze in as many as you can on a trip to the region.

        'Delta flight forced back to Amsterdam after maggots fall onto passenger',
    content: '''
Yep, those creepy creatures that thrive on fetid foods and waste have joined the pantheon of things that can cause a flight to change course and ruin travel plans.

On Tuesday, Delta Air Lines Flight 133 departed Amsterdam, Netherlands, bound for Detroit, Michigan. But one hour into the flight, the Airbus A330-300 had to turn back to Amsterdam’s Schiphol Airport after maggots reportedly fell onto a passenger from an overhead bin, according to Detroit TV station FOX 2 (WJBK).

The station interviewed passenger Philip Schotte, a Netherlands native now living in Iowa, who said he saw about a dozen of the creatures on a woman sitting next to him.

“She was freaking out. She was just trying to kind of fight off these maggots. … I don’t really know what was going through my mind.  I was trying to process it – disgust is one thing of course. We had to wait there for help to actually come,” Schotte told the station.

    title: '‘The Love Boat’: How a TV show transformed the cruise industry',
    content: '''
From steam-powered ships, to mega-liners, the cruise industry has been through quite a transformation over the years. And the market has skyrocketed.

Back in 1970, an estimated 500,000 people went on a cruise holiday. That figure had jumped to five million by 1997.

So what brought about this sudden surge in interest? According to industry experts, it was mainly down to a certain TV show with a catchy theme tune.

“Come aboard, we’re expecting you!”

Produced by TV legend Aaron Spelling, ”The Love Boat” first aired in 1977 and went on to become one of the most successful shows in TV history during its decade-long run.

The program, which is still available on streaming services such as Paramount Plus, partnered with Princess Cruises, and episodes were filmed aboard various Princess Cruise ships, the Pacific Princess and Island Princess being the most notable.

        'This US couple built an oceanfront home in the Bahamas. Then a hurricane hit',
    content: '''
They’d always dreamed of living by the ocean, but when they first visited the Bahamas back in 1985, Norvell and Mark Slezycki never imagined that they’d have their very own oceanfront home in the island country.

The couple, who were living in New York City at the time, “stumbled upon” the Abaco Islands, located north of Nassau, and were struck by how underdeveloped the island chain was at the time.

“We kept coming back, almost every year,” Norvell tells CNN Travel. “And exploring all of the other islands in the chain, staying at just about every island.

“And we just fell in love with the whole idea of some islands that could still be so undeveloped.”

    title: 'Australian nude beach faces possible closure',
    content: '''
Tyagarah Beach, a secluded 800-meter (875-yard) stretch of beachfront north of Byron Bay, has been the topic of heated debate in recent weeks.

The beach, long loved by naturists from Australia and around the world, is part of the Tyagarah Nature Reserve and maintained by the New South Wales state government.

Last year the state government wrote to the local council complaining that public nudity was “not consistent with the values the reserve is managed under,” according to CNN affiliate 9News.

The move is part of a broader strategy launched by the Byron Bay Shire Council, which unveiled a plan for managing the Nature Reserve.

On February 22, the council will vote on whether to revoke the beach’s clothing-optional policy.

        'Canadian arrested for allegedly opening plane door, deploying evacuation slide in Thailand',
    content: '''
A Canadian man has been arrested in the northern Thai city of Chiang Mai after he allegedly opened the door on a commercial plane and triggered the evacuation slide prior to takeoff.

According to a statement issued by the Chiang Mai International Airport, the incident took place on the night of February 7.

The air traffic control tower was reportedly notified at 10:05 p.m. that Thai Airways flight TG121, due to depart for Bangkok’s Suvarnabhumi International Airport, was waiting in line on the runway to take off when a passenger opened one of the plane’s doors, causing an evacuation slide to deploy.

The Airbus A320 was unable to be immediately moved, temporarily preventing other flights from taking off and landing, said the statement.

“After receiving the alert, we reached out to Thai Airways mechanics to get into the site to cut the evacuation slide off, then we towed the aircraft back to landing pit number 15,” said Wing Commander Ronnakorn Chalermsanyakorn, director of Chiang Mai International Airport, in the statement.

The director added that 13 flights in total were affected by the incident, including eight that were forced to circle in the air before being cleared to land. In total, 2,295 passengers were affected by the delays, said Ronnakorn.

Chiang Mai officials say 2,295 passengers were affected by the February 7 incident.

Aside from a one-off trip to Europe, the furthest Jessica Gee ever traveled while growing up was to Walt Disney World in Florida with her family.

However, over the past eight years, the travel influencer, known as “The Bucket List Mom,” has visited more than 90 different countries with her entrepreneur husband Garrett and their three children Dorothy, Manilla and Calihan.

“I never had the thought in my brain that ‘I want to travel around the world,’” Gee, from Denver, Colorado, tells CNN Travel. “That was never me. But the more I get out there, the more I want to see.”

According to Gee, everything changed when her husband, who she first met while on a church service mission in Vladivostok, Russia, sold his app to Snapchat for \$54 million in 2014 and decided to quit his desk job.
